# monome-span

A little tool for joining a couple of monome's together. Only works with apps that work exclusively with `/grid/key` and `/grid/led/set` messages and talk to and from a fixed port (Renoise Duplex).

It's only really up here to stop me losing it again.

## Usage

Build with:
`lein uberjar`

Run with:
`java -jar /path/to/monome-span/target/monome-span-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone`
